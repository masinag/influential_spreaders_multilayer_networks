### Description of the dataset

We consider different types of social relationships amoung users, obtained from Twitter during an exceptional event. In this specific dataset we focused on [People's Climate March](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peopleâ€™s_Climate_March) in 2014

The multiplex network used in the paper makes use of 3 layers, corresponding to retweet, mentions and replies observed between


    Start: 2014-09-19 00:46:19
    End: 2014-09-22 06:56:25

There are 102439 nodes, labelled with integer ID between 1 and 102439 and 353495 connections.
The multiplex is directed and weighted (obtained by summing up the number of a specific type of interaction over time), stored as edges list in the file

    NYClimateMarch2014_multiplex.edges

with format

    layerID nodeID nodeID weight

The IDs of all layers are stored in

    NYClimateMarch2014_layers.txt

The IDs of nodes (note that screen names are not provided for privacy reasons) can be found in the file

    NYClimateMarch2014_nodes.txt


In addition, online interactions of users are provided with the temporal information in the file

    NYClimateMarch2014_activity.txt

with format

    nodeID nodeID timestamp type

where timestamp is in seconds and type is the layer name. There are 413350 temporal interactions, in total.

Note 1: the direction of links depends on the application, in general. For instance, if one is interested in building a network of how information flows, then the direction of RT should be reversed when used in the analysis. Nevertheless, the choice is left to the researcher and his/her own interpretation of the data, whereas we just provide the observed actions, i.e., who retweets/mentions/replies/follows whom.

Note 2: users mentioned in retweeted tweets are considered as mentions. For instance, if @A retweets the tweet 'hello @C @D' sent by @B, then the following links are created: @A @B timeX RT, @A @C timeX MT, @A @D timeX MT, because @C and @D can be notified that they have been mentioned in a retweet. Similarly in the case of a reply. If for some reason the researcher does not agree with this choice, he/she can easily identify this type of links and remove the mentions, for instance.
